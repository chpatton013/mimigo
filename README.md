linux users: you may need to install packages on your system. These include calling:
sudo apt-get install libglm-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
sudo apt-get install libglew1.6-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

NOTE THAT NOW YOU NEED SDL_image from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image
download the .tar.gz file, and run tar zxvf on the file.
then run ./configure
then make
then sudo make install

also get SDL 1.2.15 from http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php and install it in the same manner
